> An automated mouse clicker to cheat "clicker" games

I made this dumb tool to mash mouse clicks on specific screen coordinates to
cheese [Loot Clicker](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/630258). It was of
use during Steam's Summer Sale 2015 event with a similar style Monster Game.

This is crudely made with global mouse and keyboard hooks during a bored
afternoon at work. Use at your own risk!!

## Usage

Enter screen coordinates to click the mouse and a click interval (in
milliseconds), then click Start.

## Hotkeys

Because your mouse will become unusable while the clicker runs, it's better to
operate with hotkeys.

### s
Toggles the clicker

### x
Captures the current mouse position in the clicker parameter boxes

### Scroll Lock
Toggles s/x hotkeys
